Revision history for Path-Dispatcher

0.05 Sat Nov 15 16:36:41 2008
        Improve test coverage
        New rule type "Always" which always matches.

        Match:
            ends_dispatch is now an attribute

        Rule::Tokens:
            Support for case insensitive matching
            Fix for tokens' type constraint

        Dispatcher:
            Allow rules to be specified in the constructor (a typo prevented it)

        Dispatch:
            first_match, has_match methods which do what you'd expect
            The run method will now collect return values and return them

        Declarative:
            redispatch_to sugar which adds a Dispatch rule
            "on '' => sub" as a special case will match all paths

        "rewrite" rules
        Super dispatchers are GONE! Yay.
        New Rule::Dispatch which just takes some other dispatcher. nothingmuch++

        Rule::Tokens:
            Fix for always matching just a prefix whether you wanted to or not
            Make tokenization and untokenization into methods for overriding

        Declarative:
            -base is required, otherwise unrelated modules using your dispatcher
                would get their @ISA set!

        Documentation!
        Prefix matches
        "under" rules
        Remove stages until they're actually needed

        Rule:
            The codeblock is no longer required
            Empty tokens are ignored
            The token attribute is now 'delimiter' instead of 'splitter'
            Allow regexes and alternations in the token rules

        Match:
            No longer Dispatch::Match
            Created by the Rule instead of the Dispatcher

        Declarative:
            You now must subclass Path::Dispatcher::Declarative
            Allow overriding the token delimiter
