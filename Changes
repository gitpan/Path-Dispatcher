        "rewrite" rules
        Super dispatchers are GONE! Yay.
        New Rule::Dispatch which just takes some other dispatcher. nothingmuch++

        Rule::Tokens:
            Fix for always matching just a prefix whether you wanted to or not
            Make tokenization and untokenization into methods for overriding

        Declarative:
            -base is required, otherwise unrelated modules using your dispatcher
                would get their @ISA set!

            The token attribute is now 'delimiter' instead of 'splitter'
            Allow regexes and alternations in the token rules

        Match:
            No longer Dispatch::Match
