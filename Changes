        Prefix matches
        "under" rules
        Remove stages until they're actually needed

        Rule:
            The codeblock is no longer required
            Empty tokens are ignored
            The token attribute is now 'delimiter' instead of 'splitter'
            Allow regexes and alternations in the token rules

        Match:
            No longer Dispatch::Match
            Created by the Rule instead of the Dispatcher

        Declarative:
            You now must subclass Path::Dispatcher::Declarative
            Allow overriding the token delimiter
